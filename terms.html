They are not intended to be solely relied upon and are not a substitute for professional veterinary advice based on your personal circumstances. We are not liable or responsible for any actions taken due to your having read or been told about such advice or other materials. In particular, to the fullest extent permitted by law, we give no representation or warranties about the accuracy, completeness, or suitability for any purpose of the advice or other materials and information published on or through the Services. </p>
<p>If you receive advice from a Veterinary doctor or other qualified Veterinary professional which conflicts with anything contained in VetWiz then the former should take precedence.
